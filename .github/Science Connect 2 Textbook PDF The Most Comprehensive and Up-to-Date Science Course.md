One of the units in Science Connect 2 is Matter and Chemical Change. In this unit, students will learn about the structure and properties of matter, the types and effects of chemical reactions, and the applications and implications of chemistry in everyday life. Some of the topics covered in this unit include:

- Useful chemistry: Students will learn about elements, compounds, mixtures, and alloys, and how they are used for different purposes.
- Common reactions in our lives: Students will learn about combustion, corrosion, neutralization, and decomposition reactions, and how they affect our environment and health.
- Types of chemical reactions: Students will learn how to identify and predict synthesis, decomposition, single displacement, double displacement, and combustion reactions using word equations and chemical formulas.
- Reactions and the environment: Students will learn about acid-base reactions, acid precipitation, acidified lakes, and liming as a way to restore the pH balance of water.

Another unit in Science Connect 2 is Energy Transformations. In this unit, students will learn about the different forms of energy, the conservation of energy, the efficiency of energy conversions, and the sources and impacts of energy production. Some of the topics covered in this unit include:

- Energy conversions: Students will learn how to calculate kinetic energy, potential energy, work, power, and efficiency using formulas and units.
- Electric energy at home: Students will learn how electricity is generated, transmitted, distributed, and used in homes and industries.
- Energy for life: Students will learn how living organisms use food as a source of chemical energy and how they convert it into other forms of energy through cellular respiration.
- Fossil fuels: Students will learn how fossil fuels are formed, extracted, refined, and used as a source of energy and raw materials. They will also learn about the environmental and social issues related to fossil fuel consumption.
